Spedhub is a hub for parents of disabled kids living in California to gather information about services, special needs activities and special education resources. The main goal of this platform is a hub of all the various information and activities that can help kids like mine. It took me years to find all the services out there and most of the inforamtion I gather where by talking with other parents like you. Social workers, at times, don't know all the services that the regional center can provide, and if you talk with different social workers most likely than not you gather different information.

This site is where I put the information I know specifically for Nothern California, East bay Area (East bay regional center) since it is where I am based. 

Please contact me if you have more information about different regional center (they do things slightly different) or activities. I will update the site to include more vetted info as they come.

Take care,

Serena
